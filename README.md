## student-social-media-addiction-Data-Analysis-Dashboard
# The project aims to achieve this by:

Quantifying Social Media Usage: Collecting and visualizing data on how much time students spend on social media and which platforms they use most frequently.
	Assessing Impact on Academics: Measuring the correlation between social media use and academic performance, such as grades and study habits.
	Evaluating Effects on Mental Health: Exploring the relationship between social media addiction and a student's mental well-being, including sleep patterns and overall happiness.
	Identifying Social Consequences: Analyzing how social media usage influences students' relationships with family and friends.Creating a Data-Driven Dashboard: Presenting all these findings in a clear,   interactive, and easy-to-understand format for stakeholders.
## Dataset used:

## questions(kpis) 
-How many students were surveyed? (Total Participants)
-What is the gender distribution of the participants?
-How many hours per day, on average, do students spend on social media?
-What are the most popular social media platforms among students?
-What percentage of students believe social media negatively affects their academic performance?
-Is there a correlation between daily social media hours and academic grade point average (GPA)?
-How many students report difficulty concentrating on studies due to social media use?
-What is the average social media addiction score among students?
-How does the social media addiction score correlate with average hours of sleep per night?
-What is the relationship between social media usage and self-reported mental health scores?
-How many students feel anxious or stressed when they are away from social media?
-What percentage of students report conflicts with family or friends due to their social media use?

## process
# 1. Data Collection
The first step would be to gather the raw data. This is typically done through a survey or questionnaire distributed to a large number of students. The survey questions would be designed to capture all the information needed for the KPIs, such as:
-	Demographics: Age, gender, academic level, etc.
-	Social Media Usage: Daily hours spent on platforms, which platforms are used (e.g., Instagram, Facebook, TikTok).
-	Academic Performance: Self-reported grades, difficulty concentrating, etc.
-	Mental Health & Well-being: Questions related to anxiety, sleep patterns, and overall well-being.
-	Relationships: Questions about conflicts or issues with family and friends.
# 2. Data Cleaning and Pre-processing
Raw data from surveys is often messy. This stage involves cleaning the data to make it usable for analysis. Key tasks include:
-	Handling Missing Values: Deciding how to deal with incomplete survey responses (e.g., removing them, or filling them in with an average or a default value).
-	Removing Irrelevant Data: Deleting any unneeded columns or rows (e.g., timestamps of when the survey was completed).
-	Data Transformation: Converting qualitative answers into quantitative data. For example, converting text responses like "Very often" to a numerical scale (e.g., 5).
# 3. Data Analysis
Once the data is clean, it is analyzed to find patterns and insights. This is the core of the project where the questions (KPIs) are answered. This could involve:
-	Descriptive Statistics: Calculating averages, medians, and modes for variables like "Daily Hours on Social Media" and "Social Media Addiction Score."
-	Correlation Analysis: Checking for relationships between variables, such as:
-	The correlation between daily screen time and academic performance.
-	The link between the addiction score and hours of sleep.
-	Creating Key Metrics: Calculating and defining the metrics that will be displayed on the dashboard, such as "Social Media Addiction Score," "Academic Impact Score," etc.
# 4. Dashboard Design and Visualization
This is where the findings are brought to life visually. The cleaned and analyzed data is used to create the charts and graphs seen on the dashboard. This stage includes:
-	Choosing the Right Visualizations: Selecting the most effective chart types to tell the data story. For example, a bar chart for daily hours by gender, or a scatter plot to show the correlation between two variables.
-Layout and Organization: Arranging the charts in a logical flow, with the most important information at the top. The dashboard uses a clean design with distinct sections for different aspects of the analysis (e.g., Academic Impact, Mental Health).
-	Adding Filters and Interactivity: The dashboard likely has interactive elements (like the filters for "Age Group" and "Gender") that allow the user to explore the data in more detail.
-Is there a link between social media addiction and social anxiety or isolation?
